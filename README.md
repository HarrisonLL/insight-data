## Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

**For this challenge, we want to you to calculate the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month. We also want to know the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border.**
